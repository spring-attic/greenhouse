 * Imports the Spring Integration pipelines defined in the Greenhouse application.
 * This includes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A "signup" pipeline for sending welcome emails to new users</li>
 * <li>An "activity" pipeline for sending recent activity notifications and awarding badges.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Spring Integration pipelines are components best defined in XML so there's very little here other than some imports.
