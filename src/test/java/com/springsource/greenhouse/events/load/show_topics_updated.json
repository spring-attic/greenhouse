We'll then see how to use the grails-remote-control plugin to get inside your application from your functional tests to configure and how to use the grails-develop-functional-tests plugin to decrease the cycle time when writing your tests.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll discuss strategies for partitioning tests into logical groups and using the remote execution facilities of Geb to have your functional test suite run against multiple browsers and architectures.",

Next, Rossen Stoyanchev will show attendees how testing server-side code with annotated controllers and client-side code with the RestTemplate just got a whole lot easier with the new Spring MVC test support.

You will learn about the REST maturity model and what it means for a web service to be extensible. We describe how we built the proxy server using technologies such as the Spring framework, the Roo shell and Spring Data for Redis.",

That is, until CoffeeScript came onto the scene. \r\n\r\nCoffeeScript is to JavaScript as Groovy is to Java -- both give their respective base languages a thoroughly modern makeover. CoffeeScript brings string interpolation (think GStrings), null-safe property access (person?.middleName and our beloved Elvis operator), and much more to JavaScript development. Perhaps CoffeeScript founder Jeremy Ashkenas says it best: \"Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.\"\r\n\r\nCoffeeScript is more than an intellectual curiosity. It is the #1 most followed project on GitHub. It ships as a standard library in Rails 3.1. But most importantly, Brendan Eich openly acknowledges that CoffeeScript is influencing the future direction JavaScript (formally, ECMAScript \"Harmony\"). Much of what you see in CoffeeScript today will become native to JavaScript tomorrow. \r\n\r\n",

But using NoSQL databases is very different than the ACID/SQL/JDBC/JPA world that we have become accustomed to. They have different and unfamiliar APIs and a very different and usually limited transaction model. In this presentation, we describe some popular NoSQL databases \u2013 Redis, and MongoDB. You will learn about each database\u2019s data model and Java API. We describe the benefits and drawbacks with using NoSQL databases. Finally, you will learn how the Spring Data project simplifies the development of Java applications that use NoSQL databases.",

Of course, with many languages and many different deployment contexts, communication between system components can be problematic. Efficient communication between components requires agreement on payload formats, communication protocols and, for developer sanity, sophisticated language bindings. Thankfully, messaging systems such as RabbitMQ provide the perfect solution. RabbitMQ is a popular, open-source, multi-protocol messaging broker with bindings for many popular languages.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Rob Harrop, a senior RabbitMQ team member, will explore some of the options that RabbitMQ provides for multi-platform messaging. Attendees will learn how to access RabbitMQ from a variety of languages including Java, Python, Ruby and Erlang, using different protocols including AMQP and STOMP, and from different environments, including in-browser messaging using WebSockets.\r\n",

As such, it is important for Java developers to understand the actions you can take in selecting and tuning collector mechanisms, as well as in your application architecture choices.  In this session, Gil Tene (CTO, Azul Systems) will review and classify the various garbage collectors and collection techniques available in JVMs today. Following a quick overview of common garbage collection techniques including generational, parallel, stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent and mostly-concurrent algorithms, we will define terms and metrics common to all collectors. We will classify each major JVM collector's mechanisms and characteristics and discuss the tradeoffs involved in balancing requirements for responsiveness, throughput, space, and available memory across varying scale levels. We will conclude with some pitfalls, common misconceptions, and \"myths\" around garbage collection behavior, as well as examples of how some good choices can result in impressive application behavior.",
